# neuralNets
Basic neural network templates implemented using different libraries (numpy currently, will be adding pytorch and tensorflow implementations).

There are also a few ML implementations just for establishing baseline performance for certain tasks and just as sample implementations to read.

Also, if you want to test the models locally, be sure to modify the filepath variable in each of the python files to match the file path of your MNIST digit recognizer dataset.
