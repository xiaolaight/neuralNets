The purpose of activation functions is to make any deep learning model learn non-linearly.

If activation functions were not used, the end product and prediction would merely be a linear combination of the original weights and biases making it rather unsophisticated.
Furthermore, if only linear methods are considered, then there is no purpose to any hidden layers.
