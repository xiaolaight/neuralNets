Perception is essentially the first step in the AI pipeline -- it is when data is gathered.

Some examples of perception include:
- Cameras taking photos
- Force sensors measuring force
- Sound taken through microphones
- Temperature taken through thermometers

The data taken from perception is then transfered into files accessible by the computer, in which they are then processed, refined, and used to train a deep learning model.

Without perception, we cannot have any use of AI, as AI requires the data inputted from perception in order to learn and operate.
